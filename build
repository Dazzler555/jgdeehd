#ccache -s
#and dont use below codes for first 1 or 2 times, to get ccache uploaded,
#as instructed, i got enough cccahe more than 4.5gb, tough source is not buildable, still i wanna go to final steps, my intention to collect ccache is done. Let's start final build, and get shell when bulid fails too! If source is buildable we will get a final zip file, and if not buildable, we will get a shell access to fix it. 1 minute silence for source :-(
#So, i am adding back things which i removed previously! also with my bot and tg id

# upload function for uploading rom zip file

# Build command! j10 for 10 cpu, j8 for 8 cpu, otherwise memeroy will end up even its 24G
# Upload rom zip file if succeed to build! Send notification to tg! And send shell to tg if build fails!

# Let's compile by parts! Coz of ram issue!
